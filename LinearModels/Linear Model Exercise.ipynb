    "<ol>\n",
    "<li> Build logistic regression model with **l1** penalty and best value of penalty C. Find out auc score on test data for the same. </li>\n",
    "<li> For **l1** penalty plot a graph showing how number of variables with coeffient 0 increase with increasing penalty and on the same graph also show how auc score on test data moves with increasing penalty</li>\n",
    "<li> Build logistic regression model with **l2** penalty and best value of penalty C. Find out auc score on test data for the same.</li>\n",
    "<li> For linear regression problem discussed in class, examine trend between your response and fico score. Is the trend linear as we assumed?</li>\n",
